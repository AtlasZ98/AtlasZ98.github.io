  <h1>Biography</h1>
  	<p class="biograph">Hello!</p>
  	<p class="biograph">I'm an undergraduate at Tufts. I come from Nanjing, an ancient city that had been the capital of China for six dynasties in history. I'm the first person in my family studying abroad and literally the first person who studies science. I'm proud to be an engineer!</p>
  	<p class="biograph"> It's fascinating to learn as an engineer majoring in computer science, since I have the opportunity to explore more basic stuff about computation and how it is done inside electrical components.</p>
